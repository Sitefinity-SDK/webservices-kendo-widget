### This repository is not automatically upgraded to latest Sitefintiy version. The repository is monitored for pull requests and fixes. The latest official version of Sitefinity that supports this sample is 9.1. Be aware that using a higher version could cause unexpected behavior. If you successfully upgrade the example to a greater version, please share your work with the community by submitting your changes via pull request.

The sample illustrates how to use the built-in kendo transport of the client sdk. The transport is passed to the kendo datasource, which internally will use the web-services sdk to query the Sitefinity CMS services.

### Requirements

* Sitefinity CMS license
* .NET Framework 4
* Visual Studio 2012
* Microsoft SQL Server 2008R2 or later versions

Clear the NuGet cache files. To do this:

1. In Windows Explorer, open the **%localappdata%\NuGet\Cache** folder.
2. Select all files and delete them.

### Nuget package restoration
The solution in this repository relies on NuGet packages with automatic package restore while the build procedure takes place.
